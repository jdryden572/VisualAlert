HueVisualAlert controls a Philips Hue system to serve as a visual alerting 
system for the Technical Support phone queue. 

This program can be run directly by invoking "python HueVisualAlert.py" in 
the command line. For production, it was compiled into a Windows Executable
using py2exe (info at http://py2exe.org ). See comments at beginning of 
setup.py for directions on compiling into executable.

HueVisualAlert uses the phue module by Nathanaël Lécaudé. More info can be
